## About
- This will teach you a basic block chain algorithm. You will learn how to create a simple blockchain and how to make it immutable. In future commit, you will see how to perform transactions in blockchain.

## What is Blockchain?
- As name suggest, blockchain is a the chain of smaller blocks, which contains data. A single block has 3 important part : 
    ###### Data : The data which block holds.
    ###### Hash : The hash code of current block.
    ###### Previous Hash : The hashcode of previous block, this maintain continuity.

## What is GenesisBlock?
- This is the very first block of BlockChain. You can say block chain starts from here. It does not contain the hash of previous block.

## Is this Linked List?
- Yes, You can say. It works like linked list but instead of connecting with address, It works on the base of hash of the block

## What makes BlockChain immutable?
- As any one try to tamper block chain by changing its hash or data, its hash and previous hash regenrated and a every single user has a seperate copy of blockchain which we called digital ledger, it finds out the odd man out and deny the verification process.
